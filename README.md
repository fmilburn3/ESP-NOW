# ESP-NOW

A demonstration of how to use ESP-NOW to send and receive data on the ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE. ESP-NOW sends data between two or more ESP devices without the use of a router. It is smaller in footprint and quicker than going through a router.

Code was developed on Wemod D1 Minis using Arduino 1.8.4

send.ino is a simple "hello world" type program demonstrating how to send data using ESP-NOW with the ESP8266 receive.ino received the data from send.ino sketch above
HC-SR04.ino demonstrates the use of an ultrasonic distance sensor on the ESP8266 PIR.ino demonstrates a PIR sensor on the ESP8266 RCWL-0516 demonstrates a "radar" detector on the ESP8266

The sensor folder contains send and receive sketches using the Arduino IDE and the sensors above. Pin setup is the same as described in the three sketches above.
